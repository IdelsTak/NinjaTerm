Motivation
==========

The embedded-engineering world (i.e. anything with a circuit board and a microcontroller) needs serial port applications. They are instrumental when it comes to debugging, data transfer, configuring and logging embedded systems.

The simple serial port programs that already exist do not have any powerful features. The really powerful serial port programs that already exist have some nice features but have a "busy" UI and are 1990's looking. There is also some particular features that no serial port programs has which would make debugging that little less painful.  

Features
========

- Cross-platform application.
- ANSI escape sequence support.
- Smart toggling between terminal fixed-position and auto-scroll.
- Data logging (to file), with selective logging, smart file name generation and time stamping options.
- Arduino compatible.
